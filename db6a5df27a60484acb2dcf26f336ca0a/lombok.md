# lombok

- it gives annotations to make life easier like getters and setters
- it is a compile time code generator - more like babel in frontend world which changes the code during bundling process

## compile time generation - how is it done?

## annotations

- `@Data`: creates setters, getters, hashCode and toString methods
- `@NoArgsConstructor`: creates exactly that, but creating manually would be easier though I guess
