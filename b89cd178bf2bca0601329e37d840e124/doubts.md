# doubts

- is it better to ask client to send complete info or just the bare min and then fetch the latest from the DB and do the operation? I'm thinking latter, ask client to send as less as possible and take a lock or something?
- what's the difference between a bean and an object?

  - is bean something that's created by [[spring]] using IoC and stuff?

- how to see long running transactions in the system? and debug them? put an upperbound to them?
- how to specify spring datasource host names? and update them at runtime?
