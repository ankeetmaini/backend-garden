# @Component

- can be put on a class and then it means [[spring]] will manage its lifecycle

  - creation, death etc

- @Controller is a specialized form of @Component wherein it associates a `Model` and a `ViewResolver` with it

  - Model gives the data to the ViewResolver - usual server side rendered applications
  - ViewResolver can be anything I presume - JSP, JSON

- @Controller can be mixed with @ResponseBody to send json to caller, otherwise as per this book it sends both (model + view)
