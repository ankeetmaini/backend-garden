# Templates

- these are the implementations for the [[Operations]] interface
- these templates contain the concrete code to talk to various DBs and stuff
- these are I think the basic building blocks for [[repository]] to work
- I read that [[repository]] builds on top of Templates

some of the notable in-built templates are:

## [[RedisTemplate]]


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[repository]: repository.md "repository"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
