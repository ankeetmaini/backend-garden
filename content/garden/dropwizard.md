# dropwizard

- [[application]] + [[configuration]] = app
- [[Configuration]] class is present in every dropwizard app and its values come from a yaml file
- [[jersey resources]] are the controllers of a dropwizard app

  - they are classes that can be scoped to serve urls
  - they can get GET, POST etc methods inside that
  - [[doubts]] what's [[jersey]]?
  - before they start working you have to register the resource - no automatic scanning of annotations I guess
    - this is done in the [[application]] class's `run` method

  ```java
  @Override
  public void run(HelloWorldConfiguration configuration,
                Environment environment) {
    final SomeResource resource = new SomeResource();
    environment.jersey().register(resource);
    // do this multiple times :/
  }
  ```

  ## validations
  - using @Valid annotation - JSR 303 I think, it can automatically return the correct code to client
  - you can also use `ConstraintViolations` to programmatically map through the violations and do something about it
  - also it supports both `javax.util.validation` and Hibernate Validators

  ## coding best practises

  - if you need to give out clients; it's best to separate the representations i.e. the objects entities in one single package or folder
  - then another for client which uses a web client and connects to the server
  - server contains the actual logic - it contains the jersey resources
  - all of the external connections like DB etc need to come via yaml file which is parsed to the [[configuration]] class object and the app can use it with `environment` maybe in the run method
