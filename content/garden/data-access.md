# data-access

- entities that are persisted are called `domain` objects, so I'll now place them under domain package
- also another way to know if a class is a `domain` class or not is that if it needs [[@Entity]] annotation then it is
- all stuff related to data access and interfacing over dbs is called a [[repository]] in [[spring]]
