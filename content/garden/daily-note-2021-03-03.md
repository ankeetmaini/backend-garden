# Journal Entry, Wednesday, March 3

- [[couchdb]] when not replicated for a long time, the replication takes a long time and can even add latency to the queries
- #shading vs #nesting jars

  - shading means taking app code jar and take all dependencies and see if they work together - very difficult IMO
  - this is same in frontend as well, bundle one fat bundle, bower vs npm -> bower was flat only one version but npm could nest!
  - nesting maintains the dependency requirement of peers, and thus can have multiple copies of the same jar in the final bundle. #confirm

- [[maven]] or [[gradle]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[couchdb]: couchdb "couchdb"
[maven]: maven "maven"
[gradle]: gradle "gradle"
