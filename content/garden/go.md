# go

- it's a compiled language
- use `go run <filename.go>` when trying to run the code as a script
- use `go build <filename.go>` when you want to build a binary - so cool

> no runtime needed for the package to be deployed, isn't it the best?

- go tools and 3rd party libs are managed differently than JavaScript, there's no central registry. Everything is done via git repositories

```bash
go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
```

- what it does behind the scenes is fetch the code, build it and add it to $GOPATH/bin, since it's a binary nothing to install, just use it as a command

  - [[doubts]] how would it work inside the program?

### formatting, linting

- go comes with a formatter by default - `go fmt <filename.go>`
- no prettier required :P
- `golint .` works and finds lint mistakes
- `go vet <filename.go>` finds unused vars etc

### build

- [[go]] uses [[make]] to build the projects

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[doubts]: doubts.md "doubts"
[go]: go.md "go"
[make]: make.md "make"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
