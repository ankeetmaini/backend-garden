# spring

- tenets of Spring boot

  - dependency management
  - auto-configuration
  - simple deployment - I know k8 and docker, heh

- main annotations
  - [[@SpringBootApplication]]
  - [[@Component]]
- [[REST]] is the way stuff works now
- #spring bean - is something that's created by Spring and its lifecycle is managed from within the Spring framework - user never specifies it's creation or GC #confirm
