# slice

- concat slices?? just like JavaScript's spread operator but the three dots come after instead of before as shown in example

```go
  var x = []int{2, 3, 5}
	var y = []int{20, 30, 50}
	x = append(x, y...)
```

## how they are stored internally

- when you use `append` the slice is not modified but a new slice is created and the older values are copied over to the new slice
- [[go]] is pass by value not reference - so any params that are passed to functions are copied inside that's why you need to assign the value of `append` back to the same variable

## capacity

- slice uses contiguous memory cells and if you increase the size it has to check if the memory locations are available or not
- so it's not very efficient to increase and allocate on the go - wasted cpu cycles in copying older values to the newer array

## make

- so if you know the size in advance use `make` to create a slice of the recommended size

```go
x := make([]int, 5, 10)
// type, length, capacity
```

> never specify the capacity lesser than length cuz now you know what's what
