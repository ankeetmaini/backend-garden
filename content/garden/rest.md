# REST

- stands for **reprsentational state transfer**
- why is it awesome?

  - app A can talk to app B and both can be totally stateless
  - they don't have to remember the previous context as everytime they talk both send their current state, the other can just use and do what it wants
  - so any application can go down and it doesn't have to worry that all the conversation which happened is lost assuming everything is stored in-memory

- never use #integer as [[database]] #primarykey as it will overflow after 2.1 billion records and you can go viral for all the wrong reasons
